4_1_STAIRWAY_scripts

The scripts used for the RAD based analyses.

Each script corresponds to a step of the entire analysis pipeline which was executed in the following order:

- STACKS: process_radtags.sh

Process_radtags separate reads per by sample ID creating four fastq files per sample ID
(sample_xxx.1.fq, sample_xxx.2.fq, sample_xxx.rem.1.fq, sample_xxx.rem.2.fq). These are 
the data files deposited in GenBank's SRA archive.

Fastq read files from the same sample ID (i.e., from different RAD libraries) were
combined (using cat_command.sh), after which the infiles for ANGSD were generated applying 
the following script in the listed order:

- BOWTIE: bowtie2_alig.sh
- SAMTOOLS: sam_to_sortedbam.sh
- ANGSD: sfs.sh followed by sfs2.sh

After generating the site frequency spectrum (SFS), the SFS was added to the corresponding
blueprint file. The blueprint files used in the paper are all included in this repository.

The blueprint files serves as the input for generting the final STAIRWAY plot. The final
STAIRWAY plot was generated as follows (available at the STAIRWAY manual for ver. 2.0 beta): 

java -cp stairway_plot_es Stairbuilder file.blueprint

The command above creates the script file.blueprint.sh, which then is executed to produce 
the final STAIRWAY plot (i.e., file.blueprint.plot.sh)


4_2_RAD_ID_files directory

One file per species with the list of RAD sample identification IDs. Each line corresponds to 
a sample ID. 


4_3_STAIRWAY_blueprint_files

The input files used to run stairway plot with minimum coverage of 2x and 10x.

Each blue print file contains: Total number of sites, including monomorphic sites (line 5).
The folded site frequency spectrum (line 7). Additional information is included as well, 
such as the employed mutation rate (line 16) and generation time (line 17).


4_4_RAD_data_information 

A single Microsoft Excel<sup>TM</sup> file (and corresponding individual, plain tab-separated, text files)
with the RAD data set information.
