This directory contain the scripts used for the RAD based analyses (“script” directory)
Additionally, it contains the used data (links in the “rad_data” directory), list of sample 
identification IDs (“IDs_files” directory) and the input file used to run stairway plot 
(“blueprint” directory). 

Each script corresponds to a step of the entire analysis pipeline which was executed in 
the following order:

- STACKS: process_radtags.sh

Process_radtags separate reads per by sample ID creating four fastq files per sample ID
(sample_xxx.1.fq, sample_xxx.2.fq, sample_xxx.rem.1.fq, sample_xxx.rem.2.fq). These are 
the data files deposited in GenBank's SRA archive.

Fastq read files from the same sample ID (i.e., from different RAD libraries) were 
combined (using cat_command.sh), after which the infiles for ANGSD were generated applying 
the following script in the listed order:

- BOWTIE: bowtie2_alig.sh
- SAMTOOLS: sam_to_sortedbam.sh
- ANGSD: sfs.sh followed by sfs2.sh

After generating the site frequency spectrum (SFS), the SFS was added to the corresponding
blueprint file. The blueprint files used in the paper are all included in this repository.

The blueprint files serves as the input for generting the final STAIRWAY plot. The final 
STAIRWAY plot was generated as follows (available at the STAIRWAY 
manual for ver. 2.0 beta): 

java -cp stairway_plot_es Stairbuilder file.blueprint

The command above creates the script file.blueprint.sh, which then is executed to produce
the final STAIRWAY plot (i.e., file.blueprint.plot.sh)
